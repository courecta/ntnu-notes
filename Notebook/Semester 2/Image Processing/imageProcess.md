## Chapter 1: Introduction
What is image processing?

Image Processing is for humans.

- Low-level processing
  - ex. threshold or noise removal 
- Mid-level processing
  - ex. grouping or clustering
- High-level processing
    
### Sampling

This process digitizes a cont. function into a discrete one
However, a side-effect may be under-sampling, which comes from not sampling enough discrete data points to reconstruct a fluid, continuous data stream. (As such, there are criterion to standardize sampling practices from data. ex. Nyquist, Whittaken-Shannon)
    
### Images as 2-D functions

When phenomena such as under-sampling occur, it may produce a grid effect, this is due to not enough data being

There may also be false contours or "false quantization" is produced by insufficient quantization of gray levels

### 1.4 Images and Digital Images

- A scene is a 3-D continuous function [ g(x, y, z) ]
- An image is a 2-D continuous function [ f(x, y, z) ]
- A digital image is a 2-D discrete function [ I(r, c) ]

- A pixel is a picture element
- Thus, gray level can be determined by 256 values from 0 ~ 255

### 1.8 Types of digital images

#### Typically for photography
- Grayscale Images
- Binary Image
- Color Images
- Multi-spectral Images

#### Usually for medical uses

- Radio Images
- Ultrasound Images
- Ultraviolet Images
- X-ray Images
- Gamma-ray Images
- X-ray transmission computerized tomography (CT) Images
- Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Images
- Other types of general and special images produced by medical tools and machines

#### For physical object scanning

- Range Images
- Moire Images
- Structure light Images

#### However, there are many types as well found in nature in the form of *Biological eyes*

### 1.9 The human eye

We perceive using cones in our eyes

We have three types of cones
- **g( &alpha;, &beta;, &gamma; )**
- **RGB**
- **LMS**

### 1.10 Image Perception

-- We here remark the limitations of the human visual system

As a biological organism, we are susceptible to *optical illusions* and *subjective objects*

There exists types such as,

- Simultaneous contrasts
- Overshoots / Undershoots
- Distance illusions
- Imaginary shapes or faces ( where there aren't any )

## Chapter 2 - Image Files and file types

- An image is essentially a binary file, we can see this in a hexadecimal dump

An Image file contains 2 elements

1. A header which represents all of the metadata of an image, such as its size, color, and compression method
2. Its image data with its index and pixel values

There are many image file types such as:

- BMP ( Microsoft Bitmap Pattern )
  - No compression, needs larger storage
- JPEG ( Joint Photo-Graphics Experts Group )
  - lossy compression, needs less storage
- GIF ( Graphics Interchange Format )
  - lossless compression
- TIFF ( Tagged Image File Format )
  - Multiple images
- PNG ( Portable Network Graphics )
  - lossless compression

> [!NOTE] BMP File
> Usually isn't compressed. Its header consists of 14 bytes and with information of 40 bytes

> [!NOTE] PNG Format
> Supports Gamma correction and has alpha channels that can associate various transparencies with the image ( it can be split into foreground and background, etc. )

> [!IMPORTANT] What is Gamma Correction?
> Uses the non-linear nature of perceived light and color with the formula of V<sub>out</sub> = AV<sub>in</sub><sup>&gamma;</sup>

## Chapter 3 - Image Display

### How good an image looks is dependent on multiple factors such as:

1. Image quality
   - Spatial resolution
   - Grayscale resolution
2. Display Device
   - What display are you using? Monitor types, resolution, or graphics card
3. The working environment such as ambient lighting

#### Image quality

There are also bit images. Whereas the traditional grayscale image has 256 values ( 0 ~ 255 ) represented by 8 bits ( 2<sup>8</sup> ) , a bit image consists of 8 bit planes, where its values are only 0 and 1.

> [!CAUTION] Bit image order
> the most significant bit image plane has the most important data at the 7th bit plane
>
> the least significant bit plane is the 0th bit plane with the least important data

There are 2 phenomena that occur from using digital images as we have already mentioned

- The grid effect which comes from spatial resolution
- False contours which comes from quantization, which is a consequence of grayscale resolutions
- Another is uniform quantization, which depends on the printers or the display device

> [!IMPORTANT] Dithering
> The process of reducing the number of gray levels in a image using patterns of dots to simulate those replaced shades of gray. Possible with techniques such as Half-toning

> [!CAUTION] Half-toning
> Representing an images with 2 tones ( Black & White )

#### Dithering process

## Chapter 4 - Point Processing

#### Image processing: Transforms the values of pixels

> [!NOTE] Point processing vs Neighborhood processing
> Point: applies a function to each pixel
> Neighborhood: applies a function to a group of pixels

Point processing y = f ( x )

- Addition and subtraction
  - y = f ( x ) = x + C
  - y = f ( x ) = x - C

```
if( y > 25 )
   = 255
else if( y < 0 )
   = 0
```

- Multiplication y = f ( x ) = Cx
- Complementation y = 255 - x

#### 4.3 Histogram

A histogram here plots the

- x - value to be the grayscale value from 0 to 255
- y - value to be how much times a pixel with that exact value appears in the image

They can be classified as

- Dark images
- bright images
- low contrast images
- high contrast images ( colors pop best )

Contrasts can be stretched with a transform function of the general form
```
      x - a
y = (-------) ^ Î³ ( d - c) + c
      b - a
```

#### 4.3.2 Histogram Equalization

- Change the histogram of an image to a much more uniform distribution using the transform function to form the accumulative histogram of the image

Theorem: Let T be a monotonic differentiable function. let r be a continuous random variable with density p<sub>r</sub>. Let s = T ( r ) with density p<sub>r</sub>. Thus,

> [!IMPORTANT] Theorem
> $$
> P_{s}(s) = P_{r}(r) \mid\dfrac{dr}{ds}|
> $$

- note that in real world problems, usually, the transform function can be used even if the function is not strictly monotonic

## Chapter 5 - Neighborhood Processing

- While point processing applies a function to each pixel
- Neighborhood processing applies a function to each neighborhood of pixels

Neighborhoods have masks that can have different shapes and sizes

Every mask has a reference point

A mask + function = filter

#### But what is a filter?

- 1-D mask of a 3 contiguous pixel shape with a 1/3 function takes those 3 pixels and applies the 1/3 function to them
- 2-D applies the same but with 2 dimensional masks and functions

- An example is spatial filtering which applies a function to take a fraction of the original discrete function and allow them to become more even
- This is actually a type of noise filtering, or removal

- Image filtering uses a reference point filter to process
1. Using an input image
2. it looks at the current pixel under consideration
3. then it identifies its pixel neighborhood
4. then it applies the filter
5. The entire neighborhood is then applied with the filter
6. then the sum of all products is obtained
7. Then value replacement takes place
8. The output pixel is then used to replace the original pixel in (2)
9. Thus, an output image is produced
