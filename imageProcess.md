What is image processing? <br>
Image Processing is for humans.<br>
    <ul>
        <li>Low-level processing</li>
        ex. threshold or noise removal 
        <li>Mid-level processing</li>
        ex. grouping or clustering
        <li>High-level processing</li>
        ex. Object recognition or scene understanding 
    </ul>
Sampling<br>
This process digitizes a cont. function into a discrete one<br>
However, a side-effect may be undersampling, which comes from not sampling enough discrete data points to reconstruct a fluid, continuous data stream. (As such, there are criterion to standardize sampling practices from data. ex. Nyquist, Whittaken-Shannon)<br>
    
Images as 2-D functions<br>
When phenomena such as undersampling occur, it may produce a grid effect, this is due to not enough data
