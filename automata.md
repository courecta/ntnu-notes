# Formal Languages & Automata [Spring 2024]

## First Lecture

> We look at the problems set by Hilbert, Turing & Church, and Chomsky that allows us to examine just what exactly language is.

> Languages can be classified into 4 types, each a subset of the one before

FORMAL --> RECURSIVE --> CONTEXT-SENSITIVE --> CONTEXT-FREE --> REGULAR

> Each language type in the hiearchy also has its own automaton equivalent description

> This brings up the fact that we are actually studying the fundamental capability and limits of what can or cannot be computed by computers (Automata theory, Computability theory, and Complexity theory)

> We may also observe that a fundamental issue is what makes a problem hard or easy. (Is sorting an easy or hard problem? What about a subset sum?) --> (Given a set of integers, is there a subset of integers that sum up to zero?)

The central problem of complexity theory is what makes some problems hard, while some others easy

> We can observe that computability and complexity are closely related.
